<h1>Engage Social Factor 1</h1>
<h3>Friday, May 11th, 2012 - Evening</h3>

<p>Recently, I've found that I have wanted to be more connected than I have in past years.  I've generally eschewed Facebook, Twitter and other social networking services. My general impression is that if I want to talk to you, I'll talk to you.  If you want to talk to me, you can talk to me.  I didn't really feel the need to use these social networks to do this - I had a cell phone and I had email, and I used both constantly.</p>

<p>The big change for me, I think, was realizing that most of my longer term friends have fallen out of contact with me - not because they didn't try to stay in touch, but because I tend to neglect non-immediate relationships.  I have more recent friends that I connect with directly in different ways, but I'm extremely bad about staying in touch or responding in a timely fashion.  My prioritization is on work email - if you're not writing me at my work email (and even then only if you capture my attention), I'll mentally file it under "Process Later"... and never come back to it.</p>

<p>I've gotten a little better with texts, but overall, I realized that I was probably losing touch with people I like and wanted to stay in touch with.  This sucks.</p>

<p>Further, as time has progressed, I also realized it made me into a modern hermit.  It is hard to represent yourself as a relevant technologist when you actively avoid Facebook. These services have had a massive impact on every aspect of consumer technology.  More and more services are leveraging social networking for traditionally local silos; my lack of experience in this area was a drag on my own skill set.</p>

<p>I joined Google+, but it didn't quite suffice on either front.  The dam cracked, and I joined Facebook on a recent trip.  So, here we are.  To my friends, I'm sorry for falling out of touch.  If I haven't added you on Facebook; please add me!  I try to check it every day or two.  I'm still getting the hang of things, so my apologies if I end up spamming you with random crap.  I'm very permission phobic, but the control doesn't seem super granular yet.  I'm still at odds with some of the fundamental aspects of these networks (faux friends, privacy loss, time sinks, etc), but I'm going to suck it up and participate.</p>

<p>As for this blog, I've tried to blog in stops and starts over the years, to generally no avail.  We'll see how long I can keep this up.  I intend to share my general thoughts on my industry and my own personal projects.</p>
