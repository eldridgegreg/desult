<h1>Miscellaneous</h1>

<h3>Friday, June 22th, 2012 - Late, again.  Again.</h3>

<p>Quick updates.  Did a quick new project.  Feature ideas for blog.  Self-recrimination. Home media sharing.  I'm sure you're salivating by now.  I'm absolutely sure of it.  You can't help it!</p>

<h2>Did you say PuTTY?</h2>

<p><img src="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/uploaded_images/putty_clay-738871.jpg" width="50%" /> <br />
<em><a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/12/im-feeling-silly.html" title="A lot of putty.">A massive, massive amount of putty.</a></em></p>

<p>Necessity being the father of invention, I did an ultra quick and dirty repackage of PuTTYgen from the wonderful <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/" title="PuTTY project">PuTTY</a> today.  My company still is mostly in Windows land, and I always get SSH keys in PPK format, because everyone uses PuTTY.</p>

<p>This is useless to me on ye olde Macintosh - I usually just make them convert it and resend it.  This has become an annoying cycle.</p>

<p>PuTTYgen can convert the file to PEM easily... but the binaries are for Windows.  A quick googling turned up no easy solution (instead requiring MacPorts - I went down this road installing GIMP a while back, and it made me happy to pay for Photoshop, if that says anything).  I scratched my head about what would be necessary for my own use, and concluded that it was likely that I could just rip it out of the source.  It turned out the entire PuTTYgen utility compiled fine in Xcode without any modification.  So, if you ever need it, <a href="https://github.com/eldridgegreg/puttygen-osx" title="PuTTYgen Mac OS X port">here you go!</a>.</p>

<h2>Features for blog...</h2>

<p>Of course, a few days after I finish my little blog generator, I am finding ways in which it is not quite what I want.  <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" title="Markdown">Markdown</a>'s handling of little HTML intricacies isn't quite what I want (image sizing, other layout issues).  This is, of course, as designed - that's OK.  I doubt I'm going to move away from Markdown, but I might tweak it a little bit, or see if I can find a forked version that does what I need.</p>

<p>More interesting is the idea of an RSS feed.  I think this should be a simple artifact of my existing generation process, especially once I add TOC generation, but I need to learn about what exactly goes into the feed.  I haven't looked at the guts of an RSS feed for quite a while.  I don't have any idea if anyone would want to subscribe to this, but it'd be a fun exercise.  Hopefully I'll spin out version 2 sometime in July.</p>

<h2>Bad to the bone</h2>

<p>I've been updating my blog a lot lately - and that means I'm not doing as much work on my projects as I would like.  I plan to catch up this weekend.  We'll see.</p>

<h2>Home Media Sharing</h2>

<p>Right now, I'm headed down the road of iTunes and Apple TV.  I'm OK with this for the minute, but there are a lot of annoying pieces so far.  Part of the problem is the iPad Videos app - the default iOS app is quite fragile when it comes to metadata.  It's never clear what exactly will trash the metadata store on the device, but it happens very frequently.  My first run-in with this was due to TV episode ID conflicts... which trashed the movie metadata for some reason.  I've recently had the symptom recur, even though I haven't added any updates.</p>

<p>I am definitely in the market for an iTunes replacement for sharing (for a variety of reasons), as well as endpoint replacements, if anyone has any good ideas.  The Apple TV interface, form factor, and price is pretty hard to beat though.</p>
