# The Baptismal Font
### Thursday, June 21th, 2012 - Late, again.

I've fiddled my fonts around to a more pleasing arrangement.  I liked the old one, but it began to feel sort of cartoony to me.  I've always been a sucker for thin Helvetica, so I'm giving that a go as my main font.  I picked a serif [Google Web Font](http://www.google.com/webfonts) to contrast a bit in headers.

I've also widened my layout a bit.  Right now it is just a bunch of dead space and looks pretty amazingly dumb, but if I want to add TOC/etc to the blog it seems like this is the way to go.  Not sure how to best utilize that space on non-blog sections.  I don't think I want the size of the site to flip around as you navigate, and I don't think I want to center off sections with no sidebar.

We'll see...
