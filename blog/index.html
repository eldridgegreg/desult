<p>I've ended up buying a Retina Macbook Pro for a variety of reasons.  That's another blog post.  This blog post is about a little utility I wrote to switch to the native resolution.</p>

<h3>Saturday, June 16th, 2012 - Evening</h3>

<p>A long, long time ago, we had a working stand mixer.  The KitchenAid Professional 600.  It served us well; we made all manner of dough with its massive hook.  One day, in the midst of such dough making, the machine gave a massive clank, and began to whir without any further motion in the actual mixing bowl.  Upon inspection, we discovered that the mixing arm assembly had somehow fallen down about half a centimeter, with no evident cause.  The mixer motor spun, but the arm spun no more.  And a mixer that stops spinning is not much of a mixer, it turns out.</p>

<h3>Friday, May 11th, 2012 - Evening</h3>
<p>Recently, I've found that I have wanted to be more connected than I have in past years.  I've generally eschewed Facebook, Twitter and other social networking services. My general impression is that if I want to talk to you, I'll talk to you.  If you want to talk to me, you can talk to me.  I didn't really feel the need to use these social networks to do this - I had a cell phone and I had email, and I used both constantly.</p>
