                <p>I literally cannot say anything about my current work projects.  If/when they become public, I will note them here!</p>

                <h3>P#2 - Automate Markdown conversion and TOC generation for blog.</h3>
                <p>In progress.  This seems pretty simple to do.  We'll see.  I'm sure there is some pre-built way to do this, but it seems like a fun exercise.</p>
                <h3>P#1 - Use SSI on this site.</h3>
                <p>Apache SSI.  Conquered!  <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/howto/ssi.html">This page</a> pretty much tells you everything you need to know.  Remember that if you're using execute bits, recursive templates are only processed if they are executable!</p>
