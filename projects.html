                <p>I literally cannot say anything about my current work projects.  If/when they become public, I will note them here!</p>

                <h2>Small Scale Projects</h2>
                <h4>P#3 - <a href="https://github.com/eldridgegreg/rswitch">rswitch</a></h3>
                <p>Switch Retina Macbook Pro to 2880x1800 resolution.  Free and open source.</p>
                <h4>P#2 - <a href="/blog/201206202-generator.html">Automate Markdown conversion and TOC generation for blog.</a></h3>
                <p>1.0 complete!  2.0 will expand indexing and probably do something fancier with TOC.</p>
                <h4>P#1 - Use SSI on this site.</h3>
                <p>Apache SSI.  Conquered!  <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/howto/ssi.html">This page</a> pretty much tells you everything you need to know.  Remember that if you're using execute bits, recursive templates are only processed if they are executable!</p>
